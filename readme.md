###Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (SM-N915FY / tbltexx) Kernel prepared for Kali Nethunter (WIP) 
Based on micky387's kernel source for CM/Lineage based Roms 
https://github.com/micky387/android_kernel_samsung_tblte_dpc3

###State of progress:
Kernel is booting and running on LineageOS 14.1 with a succeeding installation of Nethunter.
No further testing of working packet injection etc...
Kernel is maybe unstable and causing random reboots or shutdowns.

Test it on your own responsibility
